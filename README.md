Amherst College Electronics Club: ATmega328 sample program for using the ADC

This little program is used to sense the voltage of a CDS Resistor (light sensor), and toggle an LED on/off if the voltage is below a certain threshold. One can simply cover the sensor with their hand to see the expected behavior
